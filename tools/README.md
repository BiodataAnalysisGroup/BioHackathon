# This is the collection of tools for the Perturb-Bench pipeline.

## While testing the tools, please look first for the following information:

- What input files does the tool require (scRNAseq data, ATAC-seq data, etc) and in which format?
- What does the tool output and in which format?

Please note that if the tool only provides jupyter notebooks, we will need to summarize them into python scripts to integrate into the pipeline.
