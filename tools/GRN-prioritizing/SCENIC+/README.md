SCENIC+ is a Snakemake-based pipeline for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference that integrates single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell chromatin accessibility data (ATAC-seq). While it provides a structured approach to analyzing these data types, it comes with several technical requirements that users should be aware of.

The tool requires significant data preprocessing before analysis, including formatting and quality control steps. Additionally, it relies on a large database file that needs to be downloaded, which can take up considerable storage space (30-50 Gb). Computationally, SCENIC+ demands a substantial amount of RAM to run efficiently, especially with large datasets. While it can run on systems with lower memory, this may lead to slower processing times.

SCENIC+ can be useful for GRN analysis but requires preparation in terms of data handling, storage, and computational resources. The definite upside of SCENIC+ is the possibility to not only simulate digital gene knock outs, but also gene knock downs and gene overexpressions.
